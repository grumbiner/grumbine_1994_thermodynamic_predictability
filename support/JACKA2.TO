Dr. T. H. JackaUniversity of TasmaniaGPO Box 242cHobart, Tasmania, 7001      AustraliaDear Jo,      The revised version of my paper "The thermodynamic predictability ofsea ice" is enclosed.  The reviewer's point about the jargon in thepaper is well taken.  I've revised its usage after asking a friend whois not in either the sea ice or forecasting community to mark the jargon.I've also added a comment regarding the implications for modelling.  Thank you for taking care of this.      I'd forgotten about your working in Antarctica until Doug MacAyealmentioned it.  Having talked with you about it at the Seattlemeeting of the IGS, I should have remembered.  Another project I'mworking on is improving the US official weather forecasting model inthe polar regions.  I'd appreciate copies of your work on Antarcticclimate and weather. Sincerely,Bob Grumbinewd21rg@sun1.wwb.noaa.gov
